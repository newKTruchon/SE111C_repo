        //DECLARING VARIABLES - use keyword def; vars must be declared before they can be assigned
        var num     //declaration only

        //ASSIGNMENT - assigning/storing data to a variable (friendly name)
        num = 7     //assignment only
        
        //DECLARE & ASSIGN AT ONCE
        var num1 = 10 
        var num2 = 7

        //once variables have data assigned, they can be used in output/input/processing/conditions
        //MATHEMATICAL PROCESSING 
        var sum = num1 + num2 
        //with assignment, everything to the right of the equal sign is processed FIRST! storage occurs from the result of the right into the left

        //output for testing - developers only
        console.log(`Hello World!`)//mssg only
        console.log(num1)       //value only
        //we can also mix mssgs & stored values by using LITERAL STRINGS ` `
        //`${VAR}` will replace with stored value
        console.log(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`)

        //output for user - displayed to browser page 
        //alert() creates a pop-up; further lines will not be read until user interacts with OK button

        console.log(`alert exited`)

        alert(`The sum of ${num1} + ${num2} = ${sum}`)

        //INPUT - gaining data from a user (or somewhere else :D) into the program code
        //when asking a user for input, we need to use it some way, so we store the result to a variable
